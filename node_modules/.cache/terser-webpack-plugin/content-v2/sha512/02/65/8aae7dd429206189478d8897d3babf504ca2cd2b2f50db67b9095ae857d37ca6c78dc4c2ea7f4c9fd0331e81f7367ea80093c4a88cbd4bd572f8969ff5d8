I also had training at the TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At Drexel University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business plan for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with one of the LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have several conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that I started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired whether he would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always been a hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my Ph.D. work.

The Kosala School was one of the very few boarding schools in Odisha at that time. I got admitted to the 5th grade. I didn't take education seriously until 10th grade. The expectations from my parents and the people of the village forced me to take 10th grade seriously. I worked hard in 10th grade and transitioned myself from being a below-average performing student to achieving first-division. This transition gave me the confidence to prepare for engineering. I was admitted to Gangadhar Meher College, Sambalpur for my 10 +2 education. I was very much inclined to get into IITs; however, I was not able to qualify for their entrance examination.

I was part of the first batch that got into ceramics engineering at REC Rourkela. When we joined REC, there was no building for the ceramic engineering department and there were no faculties. Many of our seniors and classmates would question our decision to join ceramics. It was quite depressing. However, Prof. B.N. Samaddar, the first head-of-the department kept motivating us. The initial faculties, Prof. Santanu Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sukumar Adak, and Prof. Swadesh Pratihar worked hard to build the department. The lack of facilities in REC meant that we learned from industrial visits and non-conventional sources. Looking back, it is very fulfilling to transition from being underdogs to whatever little we have achieved in our career. \\\"Adversity is a stepping stone for success\\\" is we experienced firsthand.

I came with a certain business experience from Tata Refractories that influenced me towards an MBA. I used to read a lot of business books and business magazines during my days at Tata Refractories. I also had training at the TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At Drexel University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business plan for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with one of the LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have several conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that I started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired whether he would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always been a hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my Ph.D. work. Another thing that helped me a lot was the fact that I got married in my 2nd year of Ph.D. I did not have to worry about cooking or doing the laundry or the basic odd jobs so I could focus completely on my studies.

TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and visionary leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The training was not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We learned by working. When you start working and are accountable for your job, you start learning quickly. In the process, I was placed in the Dolomite Department as a Senior Officer and I was the second-in-charge there. I performed very well at Dolomite and liked my job. When you are in such an accountable position at an early age, it would likely have a positive impact on your career.

A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage in other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby, I spend time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am slowly picking woodworking as a hobby.

than ink. Life must be lived forwards, but it can only be understood backwards, through the experience of oneself and others. There is no definitive roadmap to follow for success, while the road is a huge game of Tetris. The inputs that we manage to get, must be arranged in a suitable way to make them advantageous to us. But it is the inputs that are sometimes very difficult to get owing to certain reasons.\n//                         To help everyone in this regard, NITR-ICS is going to collect such experiences and words of wisdom from successful ceramists, material scientists and industrialists who have excelled in their fields. It will be a conglomeration of important events in their journey from college to where they are now. All the information will be shared fortnightly through the label “Flashback Friday”.

<p>Memories are meant to be remembered, because even the bad memories are usually part of something we once thought was good.Memory is more indelible than ink. Life must be lived forwards, but it can only be understood backwards, through the experience of oneself and others. There is no definitive roadmap to follow for success, while the road is a huge game of Tetris. The inputs that we manage to get, must be arranged in a suitable way to make them advantageous to us. But it is the inputs that are sometimes very difficult to get owing to certain reasons.\n//                         To help everyone in this regard, NITR-ICS is going to collect such experiences and words of wisdom from successful ceramists, material scientists and industrialists who have excelled in their fields. It will be a conglomeration of important events in their journey from college to where they are now. All the information will be shared fortnightly through the label “Flashback Friday”.

I was living in a small town near Berhampur in\n                        Ganjam district. It was much like a village. I went to primary school and the Board of Secondary Education\n                        Odisha soon after. I enjoyed school life, not many complaints. There were no things like you've got become\n                        this or that. We didn't even watch television at that time. The first time I watched television, I remember\n                        it was when Mrs. Indira Gandhi died, which was around late 1984. I remember watching the cremation of Mrs.\n                        Gandhi, in a large room where close to 100 people gathered to watch that. We went to school, and we played a\n                        lot, so much so that we were playing with hardball from very early on. High school was pretty good, it was\n                        an old high school, and my father used to teach Science there, but there were no perks for that. It was a\n                        very decent school as it laid a lot of emphasis on character building. There were fewer studies and more\n                        extra-curricular.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What were your experiences during 10+2 and preparation for entrances?</h4>\n                    <p>My scores were good, and I could have gone to BJB, Ravenshaw or Khalikote College for 10+2, but for some\n                        reason, I did not, and I studied in the same locality where we had a small college. I was not interested at\n                        all in medicine. I always had REC Rourkela in my mind when I thought about engineering. There was no access\n                        to coaching for me, and I had to do all the studies myself. Sometimes I regret not having gone to\n                        Bhubaneswar or Cuttack or even Berhampur, which was nearby, because I could not get better exposure and\n                        lifestyle where I was studying. I was a lot into extra-curricular — dramatics, writing scripts, acting in\n                        plays, elocutions, debate competitions, and whatnot. In college, we were competing with students from CBSE\n                        and ICSE background, and even the medium of instruction was different. The promptness of other students\n                        during interaction in classrooms made us feel inferior, and we had our complexities and insecurities. But\n                        the last 12 years of studies and our upbringing made us really tough, and we sailed through it.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>How did you take the decision back in the 1990s to join the Ceramic Engineering branch? As today also, many\n                        are not aware of the Ceramic Engineering branch, what challenges and problems you have to face at your time?\n                    </h4>\n                    <p>I was interested in physics from the very beginning. I was not really into info-tech. I had an attraction\n                        towards understanding things physically and the basic principles behind it. Mechanical in REC was my top\n                        preference, but by the time my turn to choose came, all seats were gone. Although I could have got admission\n                        in another college, I had in my mind that I wanted to get into a college of high reputation, so I chose REC\n                        Rourkela, not ceramics in particular. But then eventually things changed for good. I had a decent amount of\n                        idea about what ceramics could be, that these are related to process industries, metallurgical process and\n                        its applications in other sectors were partially known. And it was the first time those ceramics was opening\n                        up in REC, and no other IITs or NITs offered a Bachelor's degree in ceramics so I was confident that REC\n                        Rourkela would take care of me and I won't be lost entirely.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What was the counseling procedure and what was the general perception of people regarding ceramic\n                        engineering as a branch? </h4>\n                    <p>To get admission into engineering colleges back then, we had to appear for OJEE. Colleges like REC, VSSUT,\n                        IGIT, CET, OEC, etc. granted entry based on the exam. There were 800-900 seats in total. The counseling\n                        procedure was completely manual. The rankers had to go to a counseling center, and the students were called\n                        rank wise and were asked to pick a college and branch, and corresponding change was made to the available\n                        seat matrix. It was a very long process that took days. People used to ask questions, and it was difficult\n                        explaining what you are doing. The very first thing that people identified as sanitary ware. I explained to\n                        them so exhaustively that they won't have any more questions to ask.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What kind of guidance and support did you get from your seniors and professors? </h4>\n                    <p>We were the first batch, so it was natural that we did not have any seniors in the branch, but there were\n                        other seniors from other departments. In the form of help, it was plentiful, in the sense that we were\n                        building from scratch. The first significant influence was former HOD Late Prof. B N Samaddar. He boosted\n                        our interest in ceramics and inspired us to what ceramics are and what are the various prospects. We had\n                        limited resources for laboratories and doing classes. During our 2nd year we moved to this building, and\n                        even then, the chemical engineering department and the department of metallurgical and materials engineering\n                        were reasonably helpful. From the 3rd year onwards, we were pretty much self-sufficient. We were exposed to\n                        a refined culture of studying or doing and understanding research. The departmental atmosphere was very\n                        progressive and productive, and the student-teacher interaction was the best in the institute.\n\n                    </p>\n                    <h4>How did you choose your field of interest or instead how did it find you? </h4>\n                    <p>There's this philosophy behind it.\n                        I was always interested in physical science and related stuff so according to my aptitude, I gave a name to\n                        my interest as 'Mechanical Engineering.' But in a broader sense, I was interested in knowing about the\n                        theories which would let me understand physically what is happening. So, it was just a matter of changing\n                        viewpoint, which eventually got me interested in ceramics and how one can manipulate certain things so that\n                        it will result in a desirable change in structure, microstructure and other properties.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>Why did you decide to switch from working in TRL to faculty in NITR and how did you decide that you wanted\n                        to study all the way up to Ph.D.? </h4>\n                    <p>I was an employee of TRL twice and NIT Rourkela twice. I was doing very well at TRL, and it was a very\n                        fast-paced learning process there. I installed refractories in various steel plants of SAIL and other\n                        private manufacturing units of petroleum. The professional career was up-and-coming there. It was Prof. R K\n                        Sinha, who encouraged me to pursue higher studies. He was the HOD at that time and also an advisor to TRL.\n                        Being his student, we had constant interactions in the company. During one such interaction, I was asked\n                        whether I am enjoying or not. To which I replied positively that it was exciting, but any well-trained\n                        person could do it, as it became easy after a while. After introspection, I realized that I would be better\n                        off doing intellectual stuff and would be at peace with myself. I got a Junior Lecturer post in NIT Rourkela\n                        and started teaching and doing projects with Prof. S. Bhattacharya and Prof. S. K. Pratihar. After a couple\n                        of years, I went on for Ph.D. in the USA and came back to join TRL again then joined NIT Rourkela in 2011.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What are your views on core jobs in the Ceramic field? And what according to you is the reason that many\n                        students move to analytics and are not showing interest in their branch? </h4>\n                    <p>As a B Tech graduate, the decisions are mostly influenced by what the society perceives of you. Typically,\n                        one of them is how much money you earn is kind of a measure of how successful you are. In addition to that,\n                        core industries include physically stressful manufacturing jobs, and they are not generally attractive owing\n                        to various other factors. On the other hand, non-core jobs have a lovely setting, curated building, pleasant\n                        atmosphere, air-conditioned chambers, etc. It is easy for a 22-23-year-old person to be pulled by such\n                        prospects. Adding to it, the recent explosion in opportunities in those sectors like Al, analytics, Big\n                        Data, etc. All these factors combine to the diverting of students to the non-core industry. But then some\n                        students are intrinsically wired to it, and not only for the glamour of it.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>How has the Ceramic Engineering branch of NITR evolved over these years? </h4>\n                    <p>I've seen the times when we didn't even have an inch of our department. We used to have classes in the\n                        Administrative Building, and now we have a whole big building for ourselves. That's the physical aspect. We\n                        are one of the foremost departments to have started research on nanostructured materials. Our faculties have\n                        been very productive and are getting many sponsored projects, writing papers in highly reputed journals,\n                        speaking and presenting in reputed conferences, reviewing articles as critics, and much more. In all other\n                        aspects too, we are doing tremendously well if we look at the span of just 25 years, which is a short amount\n                        of time with regards to marking the growth of a department, which is core-engineering and technology-based.\n                        In spite of the increase in capital expenses, a requirement of equipment and machines, etc. the way we have\n                        progressed is quite commendable.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What are the prospects for the students?\n                    </h4>\n                    <p>B.Tech in Ceramics or some other courses like this have got a very balanced position, and if you do well\n                        here, you can jump into anything. These are interface departments, closely connected to physics, chemistry,\n                        and basic science and is equally connected to core engineering as well. So, we are almost everywhere, and\n                        there are tremendous opportunities for a B Tech Ceramic graduate. For higher university studies, you can get\n                        into any related discipline line electronics, mechanical, bio-ceramics, nanostructured materials, physics,\n                        chemistry, anywhere you like. Some students look for a career in management and being a part of the core\n                        technical program, and they are well suited for industries. As a B Tech guy, you will do better if you know\n                        your stuff and do the managerial job as long as you can top up your profile with a management degree. Also,\n                        a promising career is as an industry professional and getting into manufacturing industries. You can do\n                        whatever you like, once you find out what you want to do.

My father was a gynecologist and\n                        he used\n                        to practice in the village. In order for us to have a better education than what was available in\n                        the\n                        village, he placed us in The Kosala School which was located in Nua Khairpali, about halfway between\n                        Bargarh\n                        and Sambalpur. The Kosala School was one of the very few boarding schools in Odisha at that time. I\n                        got\n                        admitted to the 5th grade. I didn't take education seriously until 10th grade. The expectations from\n                        my\n                        parents and the people of the village forced me to take 10th grade seriously. I worked hard in 10th\n                        grade\n                        and transitioned myself from being a below-average performing student to achieving first-division.\n                        This\n                        transition gave me the confidence to prepare for engineering. I was admitted to Gangadhar Meher\n                        College,\n                        Sambalpur for my 10 +2 education. I was very much inclined to get into IITs; however, I was not able\n                        to\n                        qualify for their entrance examination. I did decent enough in Odisha JEE. I was influenced by an\n                        article in\n                        CSR (Competition Success Review) about ceramics and that very motivated me to opt for Ceramics\n                        Engineering\n                        at REC Rourkela.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>Any particular life-changing event that occurred during the course of B.Tech. or later which led you\n                        to\n                        pursue PhD?</h4>\n                    <p>There are a lot of events during engineering days that positively influenced my life. It is difficult\n                        to pick\n                        a single event. The journey from getting admitted for ceramics engineering stream to getting a job\n                        at Tata\n                        Refractories was difficult but satisfying. I was part of the first batch that got into ceramics\n                        engineering\n                        at REC Rourkela. When we joined REC, there was no building for the ceramic engineering department\n                        and there\n                        were no faculties. Many of our seniors and classmates would question our decision to join ceramics.\n                        It was\n                        quite depressing. However, Prof. B.N. Samaddar, the first head-of-the department kept motivating us.\n                        The\n                        initial faculties, Prof. Santanu Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sukumar Adak, and Prof. Swadesh Pratihar worked\n                        hard to\n                        build the department. The lack of facilities in REC meant that we learned from industrial visits and\n                        non-conventional sources. Looking back, it is very fulfilling to transition from being underdogs to\n                        whatever\n                        little we have achieved in our career. \"Adversity is a stepping stone for success\" is we experienced\n                        firsthand. The confidence from this journey remained with me and helped in to stretch myself beyond\n                        my\n                        comfort zone. This journey helped me in opting for a Ph.D. when I wanted to advance my career\n                        despite the\n                        fact that I was not inclined to pursuing Ph.D. during my engineering college days.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>You were concurrently pursuing an MBA as well as a Ph.D. at Drexel University. How did you manage\n                        the\n                        workload? Considering the fact that you were the first student at Drexel to complete an MBA and\n                        Ph.D.\n                        simultaneously, how would you describe the journey?\n                    </h4>\n                    <p>In my opinion, you cannot plan to pursue a Ph.D. and MBA together, and neither did I. It happened\n                        because of\n                        circumstances. Throughout my career, I was much more inclined towards business than technology. I\n                        came with\n                        a certain business experience from Tata Refractories that influenced me towards an MBA. I used to\n                        read a lot\n                        of business books and business magazines during my days at Tata Refractories. I also had training at\n                        the\n                        TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At\n                        Drexel\n                        University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business\n                        plan\n                        for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with\n                        one of the\n                        LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have\n                        several\n                        conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that\n                        I\n                        started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired\n                        whether he\n                        would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always\n                        been a\n                        hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my\n                        Ph.D. work.\n                        Another thing that helped me a lot was the fact that I got married in my 2nd year of Ph.D. I did not\n                        have to\n                        worry about cooking or doing the laundry or the basic odd jobs so I could focus completely on my\n                        studies. My\n                        wife was of great help!\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    {/* </p> */}\n                    <h4>How did the initial industry exposure at TRL and further research experience inspire you to\n                        establish\n                        Y-Carbon? </h4>\n                    <p>Definitely, there is a big role of Tata Refractories Limited (TRL) in shaping my career. TRL used to\n                        hire\n                        students from engineering colleges and they used to call them graduate trainees. Before we joined,\n                        the\n                        graduate trainees got a year or a year and half of training and then you would be placed into a job.\n                        In our\n                        case, that's not what happened. TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and\n                        visionary\n                        leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The\n                        training was\n                        not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We\n                        learned\n                        by working. When you start working and are accountable for your job, you start learning quickly. In\n                        the\n                        process, I was placed in the Dolomite Department as a Senior Officer and I was the second-in-charge\n                        there. I\n                        performed very well at Dolomite and liked my job. When you are in such an accountable position at an\n                        early\n                        age, it would likely have a positive impact on your career. My experience at TRL wasn't the only\n                        factor in\n                        starting Y-Carbon, because I wasn't aspiring to start a company at that time but it did help me in\n                        my\n                        career.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>From being the general secretary of Ceramic engineering de-partment to Co-founder, CTO/CEO & Board\n                        Member of\n                        Y Carbon and now a Senior Specialist, Technology & Acquisition at Sabic you have occupied numerous\n                        positions\n                        of responsibilities. How do you manage the pressure and despondency at the same time ? </h4>\n                    <p>We generally spend more time working than any other activity. Work can be quite stressful if you\n                        don't enjoy\n                        it. Stress would naturally come to someone who is expecting a lot from his/her life. I was not very\n                        good at\n                        handling stress although I was better than others. For the last seven years, I've started spending\n                        around an\n                        hour daily on meditation and that has helped me immensely in maintaining work-life balance and\n                        calming down\n                        my restless mind. A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage\n                        in\n                        other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby,\n                        I spend\n                        time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am\n                        slowly\n                        picking woodworking as a hobby. And as time passes, when you get more mature you can handle things\n                        much more\n                        easily than when you were young. One has to understand that life is not only about work, and in\n                        order to\n                        live a complete life, he/she has to engage in non-work activities.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>A message to the students and readers.</h4>\n                    <p>In general, there are a few things that have helped me immensely in my career. One of them is I do\n                        seek\n                        advice from experienced professionals and mentors. A lot of people don't have mentors, instead, they\n                        believe\n                        in learning from their own mistakes which is great but it takes time. You can considerably\n                        accelerate the\n                        learn-ing if you learn from other's mistakes. I would suggest students have mentors so that you can\n                        learn\n                        from other's mistakes. I have been quite disappointed that the NIT Rourkela community (stu-dent,\n                        faculty,\n                        and alumni) don't make efficient use of its vast alumni base to seek guidance. Alumni can be great\n                        mentors\n                        and they can come for free.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Blog1\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Navbar from './Navbar'\n\nconst Blog2 = () => {\n    return (\n    <>\n        <div class=\"main_div\">\n            <div class=\"top_div\">\n                <div>\n                    <div id=\"logo\" style={{ cursor: \"pointer\" }}>NITR ICS</div>\n                </div>\n                <Navbar />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"proffimage\">\n                <div className=\"imagediv\">\n                    <img src=\"images/FF3.png\" />\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"infodiv1\">\n                    <p style={{margin:\"15px\",fontWeight:\"bolder\",textTransform:\"capitalize\",color:\"purple\"}}>Lorem,\n                        ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

When it came to joining engineering\n                    college, REC was one of the best at that time. According to my scores, and from what was left to choose\n                    from, I took Mining Engineering but I was particularly not interested in continuing with it. So, I decided\n                    to change my branch after the 1st year. Ceramic engineering was quite new and there was this buzz around the\n                    campus regarding the branch and material science seemed interesting to me so I chose it.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <h4>What was the change in your perception and outlook that you observed right from the day you joined REC till\n                    you completed post-doctoral research? </h4>\n                <p>Since I joined the department and went on to study the different sub-types of ceramics, I also had undergone\n                    industrial training/internship and from then on I decided that no matter what, I am not going to work in a\n                    refractory industry and spend my time in the shop floor. With that perception I pursued nano-ceramics. This\n                    continued till I completed my PhD and then I got a job at Seagate. It was smooth sailing but also with a lot\n                    of hard work. Even after the job, I was not having a mindset to work in a typical industry so I went on for\n                    post-doctoral research. But finally, I joined Vesuvius, doing the thing I had decided in the beginning that\n                    I won't. At each phase of my life, I've wanted to and tried to do something different.

I cannot totally compare the MBA in India and abroad but in a broader sense, MBA\n                    courses in developing courses like India are more Services based and here they are more inclined towards\n                    management.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                {/* </p> */}\n                <h4>What was the toughest challenge you had faced during your journey from REC to versuvius USA?</h4>\n                <p>Probably the toughest thing that I had to face was the recession of 2009. I was working as a Manufacturing\n                    Engineer till then at Seagate Technologies. The global financial crisis led to the most severe economic\n                    recession ever after 1930s. I lost my job and I was struggling for the visa and related stuff. That period\n                    of few months was the toughest for me. Eventually I made up my mind to research further about nanocomposites\n                    and nanoindentations and I started the post-doctoral research at North Dakota State University.</p>\n                <br />\n                <h4>Did you tailor make yourself to pursue a particularly attractive goal or did you choose your goal according\n                    to your interests? </h4>\n                <p>From the very beginning, it has always happened with me that I ended up doing something that I didn't want to\n                    do initially. It doesn't mean that I don't like what I do. I give my 100% in everything, be it academics,\n                    research, social life or my job. I didn't pursue a very specific goal but overall, my career was built\n                    around my interests which I gained over the time, which is, even if not so diversified, isn't just\n                    concentrated to my research areas. The drive to undertake different things and doing complete justice to it\n                    shaped my future and brought me to where I am.\n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <h4>How was your experience while pursuing PhD and post-doc?</h4>\n                <p>Pursuing PhD after B.Tech. wasn't planned. I was looking for Master's programs and I got in correspondence\n                    with several universities. I got response from North Dakota State University but it was specified that they\n                    do not offer Master's degree so I changed my application and applied for PhD. The whole experience of 5\n                    years was very good actually and I used to take classes there too, although I was not into academia much.\n                    After PhD and the job at Seagate, during post-doc, we collaborated with various research institutes and even\n                    some of the R&D units of industries like Johnson & Johnson. \n                </p>\n                <br />\n                <h4>What advice would you want to give us, the students to boost our confidence in ceramics?\n                </h4>\n                <p>Ceramics, as a branch of engineering is a very good place to be in. It is so versatile, you can jump to any\n                    sister branch say mechanical engineering, metallurgical engineering (application) and various other fields\n                    like nano materials, energy solutions too. As an emerging field of study there is a lot to explore and it is\n                    quite interesting too.

There is no definitive roadmap to follow for success, while the road is a huge game of Tetris. The inputs that we manage to get, must be arranged in a suitable way to make them advantageous to us.
