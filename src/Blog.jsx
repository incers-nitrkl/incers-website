                    <h4>Let us start with your early life and High school ?</h4>
                    <p>My early life was like any other typical student in Odisha. I was living in a small town near Berhampur in
                        Ganjam district. It was much like a village. I went to primary school and the Board of Secondary Education
                        Odisha soon after. I enjoyed school life, not many complaints. There were no things like you've got become
                        this or that. We didn't even watch television at that time. The first time I watched television, I remember
                        it was when Mrs. Indira Gandhi died, which was around late 1984. I remember watching the cremation of Mrs.
                        Gandhi, in a large room where close to 100 people gathered to watch that. We went to school, and we played a
                        lot, so much so that we were playing with hardball from very early on. High school was pretty good, it was
                        an old high school, and my father used to teach Science there, but there were no perks for that. It was a
                        very decent school as it laid a lot of emphasis on character building. There were fewer studies and more
                        extra-curricular.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>What were your experiences during 10+2 and preparation for entrances?</h4>
                    <p>My scores were good, and I could have gone to BJB, Ravenshaw or Khalikote College for 10+2, but for some
                        reason, I did not, and I studied in the same locality where we had a small college. I was not interested at
                        all in medicine. I always had REC Rourkela in my mind when I thought about engineering. There was no access
                        to coaching for me, and I had to do all the studies myself. Sometimes I regret not having gone to
                        Bhubaneswar or Cuttack or even Berhampur, which was nearby, because I could not get better exposure and
                        lifestyle where I was studying. I was a lot into extra-curricular — dramatics, writing scripts, acting in
                        plays, elocutions, debate competitions, and whatnot. In college, we were competing with students from CBSE
                        and ICSE background, and even the medium of instruction was different. The promptness of other students
                        during interaction in classrooms made us feel inferior, and we had our complexities and insecurities. But
                        the last 12 years of studies and our upbringing made us really tough, and we sailed through it.

                    <h4>How did you take the decision back in the 1990s to join the Ceramic Engineering branch? As today also, many
                        are not aware of the Ceramic Engineering branch, what challenges and problems you have to face at your time?
                    </h4>
                    <p>I was interested in physics from the very beginning. I was not really into info-tech. I had an attraction
                        towards understanding things physically and the basic principles behind it. Mechanical in REC was my top
                        preference, but by the time my turn to choose came, all seats were gone. Although I could have got admission
                        in another college, I had in my mind that I wanted to get into a college of high reputation, so I chose REC
                        Rourkela, not ceramics in particular. But then eventually things changed for good. I had a decent amount of
                        idea about what ceramics could be, that these are related to process industries, metallurgical process and
                        its applications in other sectors were partially known. And it was the first time those ceramics was opening
                        up in REC, and no other IITs or NITs offered a Bachelor's degree in ceramics so I was confident that REC
                        Rourkela would take care of me and I won't be lost entirely.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>What was the counseling procedure and what was the general perception of people regarding ceramic
                        engineering as a branch? </h4>
                    <p>To get admission into engineering colleges back then, we had to appear for OJEE. Colleges like REC, VSSUT,
                        IGIT, CET, OEC, etc. granted entry based on the exam. There were 800-900 seats in total. The counseling
                        procedure was completely manual. The rankers had to go to a counseling center, and the students were called
                        rank wise and were asked to pick a college and branch, and corresponding change was made to the available
                        seat matrix. It was a very long process that took days. People used to ask questions, and it was difficult
                        explaining what you are doing. The very first thing that people identified as sanitary ware. I explained to
                        them so exhaustively that they won't have any more questions to ask.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>What kind of guidance and support did you get from your seniors and professors? </h4>
                    <p>We were the first batch, so it was natural that we did not have any seniors in the branch, but there were
                        other seniors from other departments. In the form of help, it was plentiful, in the sense that we were
                        building from scratch. The first significant influence was former HOD Late Prof. B N Samaddar. He boosted
                        our interest in ceramics and inspired us to what ceramics are and what are the various prospects. We had
                        limited resources for laboratories and doing classes. During our 2nd year we moved to this building, and
                        even then, the chemical engineering department and the department of metallurgical and materials engineering
                        were reasonably helpful. From the 3rd year onwards, we were pretty much self-sufficient. We were exposed to
                        a refined culture of studying or doing and understanding research. The departmental atmosphere was very
                        progressive and productive, and the student-teacher interaction was the best in the institute.

                    </p>
                    <h4>How did you choose your field of interest or instead how did it find you? </h4>
                    <p>There's this philosophy behind it.
                        I was always interested in physical science and related stuff so according to my aptitude, I gave a name to
                        my interest as 'Mechanical Engineering.' But in a broader sense, I was interested in knowing about the
                        theories which would let me understand physically what is happening. So, it was just a matter of changing
                        viewpoint, which eventually got me interested in ceramics and how one can manipulate certain things so that
                        it will result in a desirable change in structure, microstructure and other properties.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Why did you decide to switch from working in TRL to faculty in NITR and how did you decide that you wanted
                        to study all the way up to Ph.D.? </h4>
                    <p>I was an employee of TRL twice and NIT Rourkela twice. I was doing very well at TRL, and it was a very
                        fast-paced learning process there. I installed refractories in various steel plants of SAIL and other
                        private manufacturing units of petroleum. The professional career was up-and-coming there. It was Prof. R K
                        Sinha, who encouraged me to pursue higher studies. He was the HOD at that time and also an advisor to TRL.
                        Being his student, we had constant interactions in the company. During one such interaction, I was asked
                        whether I am enjoying or not. To which I replied positively that it was exciting, but any well-trained
                        person could do it, as it became easy after a while. After introspection, I realized that I would be better
                        off doing intellectual stuff and would be at peace with myself. I got a Junior Lecturer post in NIT Rourkela
                        and started teaching and doing projects with Prof. S. Bhattacharya and Prof. S. K. Pratihar. After a couple
                        of years, I went on for Ph.D. in the USA and came back to join TRL again then joined NIT Rourkela in 2011.

                    <h4>What are your views on core jobs in the Ceramic field? And what according to you is the reason that many
                        students move to analytics and are not showing interest in their branch? </h4>
                    <p>As a B Tech graduate, the decisions are mostly influenced by what the society perceives of you. Typically,
                        one of them is how much money you earn is kind of a measure of how successful you are. In addition to that,
                        core industries include physically stressful manufacturing jobs, and they are not generally attractive owing
                        to various other factors. On the other hand, non-core jobs have a lovely setting, curated building, pleasant
                        atmosphere, air-conditioned chambers, etc. It is easy for a 22-23-year-old person to be pulled by such
                        prospects. Adding to it, the recent explosion in opportunities in those sectors like Al, analytics, Big
                        Data, etc. All these factors combine to the diverting of students to the non-core industry. But then some
                        students are intrinsically wired to it, and not only for the glamour of it.

                    <br />
                    <h4>How has the Ceramic Engineering branch of NITR evolved over these years? </h4>
                    <p>I've seen the times when we didn't even have an inch of our department. We used to have classes in the
                        Administrative Building, and now we have a whole big building for ourselves. That's the physical aspect. We
                        are one of the foremost departments to have started research on nanostructured materials. Our faculties have
                        been very productive and are getting many sponsored projects, writing papers in highly reputed journals,
                        speaking and presenting in reputed conferences, reviewing articles as critics, and much more. In all other
                        aspects too, we are doing tremendously well if we look at the span of just 25 years, which is a short amount
                        of time with regards to marking the growth of a department, which is core-engineering and technology-based.
                        In spite of the increase in capital expenses, a requirement of equipment and machines, etc. the way we have
                        progressed is quite commendable.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>What are the prospects for the students?
                    </h4>
                    <p>B.Tech in Ceramics or some other courses like this have got a very balanced position, and if you do well
                        here, you can jump into anything. These are interface departments, closely connected to physics, chemistry,
                        and basic science and is equally connected to core engineering as well. So, we are almost everywhere, and
                        there are tremendous opportunities for a B Tech Ceramic graduate. For higher university studies, you can get
                        into any related discipline line electronics, mechanical, bio-ceramics, nanostructured materials, physics,
                        chemistry, anywhere you like. Some students look for a career in management and being a part of the core
                        technical program, and they are well suited for industries. As a B Tech guy, you will do better if you know
                        your stuff and do the managerial job as long as you can top up your profile with a management degree. Also,
                        a promising career is as an industry professional and getting into manufacturing industries. You can do
                        whatever you like, once you find out what you want to do. Be clear about that and this program is a perfect
                        platform for going anyway you want.
