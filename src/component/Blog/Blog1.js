                    <br />
                    <h4>Where did you complete your schooling and +2 and what made you join ceramics in REC?</h4>
                    <p>I come from Hirlipali, a village in the district of Bargarh, Odisha. My father was a gynecologist and
                        he used
                        to practice in the village. In order for us to have a better education than what was available in
                        the
                        village, he placed us in The Kosala School which was located in Nua Khairpali, about halfway between
                        Bargarh
                        and Sambalpur. The Kosala School was one of the very few boarding schools in Odisha at that time. I
                        got
                        admitted to the 5th grade. I didn't take education seriously until 10th grade. The expectations from
                        my
                        parents and the people of the village forced me to take 10th grade seriously. I worked hard in 10th
                        grade
                        and transitioned myself from being a below-average performing student to achieving first-division.
                        This
                        transition gave me the confidence to prepare for engineering. I was admitted to Gangadhar Meher
                        College,
                        Sambalpur for my 10 +2 education. I was very much inclined to get into IITs; however, I was not able
                        to
                        qualify for their entrance examination. I did decent enough in Odisha JEE. I was influenced by an
                        article in
                        CSR (Competition Success Review) about ceramics and that very motivated me to opt for Ceramics
                        Engineering
                        at REC Rourkela.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Any particular life-changing event that occurred during the course of B.Tech. or later which led you
                        to
                        pursue PhD?</h4>
                    <p>There are a lot of events during engineering days that positively influenced my life. It is difficult
                        to pick
                        a single event. The journey from getting admitted for ceramics engineering stream to getting a job
                        at Tata
                        Refractories was difficult but satisfying. I was part of the first batch that got into ceramics
                        engineering
                        at REC Rourkela. When we joined REC, there was no building for the ceramic engineering department
                        and there
                        were no faculties. Many of our seniors and classmates would question our decision to join ceramics.
                        It was
                        quite depressing. However, Prof. B.N. Samaddar, the first head-of-the department kept motivating us.
                        The
                        initial faculties, Prof. Santanu Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sukumar Adak, and Prof. Swadesh Pratihar worked
                        hard to
                        build the department. The lack of facilities in REC meant that we learned from industrial visits and
                        non-conventional sources. Looking back, it is very fulfilling to transition from being underdogs to
                        whatever
                        little we have achieved in our career. "Adversity is a stepping stone for success" is we experienced
                        firsthand. The confidence from this journey remained with me and helped in to stretch myself beyond
                        my
                        comfort zone. This journey helped me in opting for a Ph.D. when I wanted to advance my career
                        despite the
                        fact that I was not inclined to pursuing Ph.D. during my engineering college days.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>You were concurrently pursuing an MBA as well as a Ph.D. at Drexel University. How did you manage
                        the
                        workload? Considering the fact that you were the first student at Drexel to complete an MBA and
                        Ph.D.
                        simultaneously, how would you describe the journey?
                    </h4>
                    <p>In my opinion, you cannot plan to pursue a Ph.D. and MBA together, and neither did I. It happened
                        because of
                        circumstances. Throughout my career, I was much more inclined towards business than technology. I
                        came with
                        a certain business experience from Tata Refractories that influenced me towards an MBA. I used to
                        read a lot
                        of business books and business magazines during my days at Tata Refractories. I also had training at
                        the
                        TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At
                        Drexel
                        University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business
                        plan
                        for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with
                        one of the
                        LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have
                        several
                        conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that
                        I
                        started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired
                        whether he
                        would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always
                        been a
                        hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my
                        Ph.D. work.
                        Another thing that helped me a lot was the fact that I got married in my 2nd year of Ph.D. I did not
                        have to
                        worry about cooking or doing the laundry or the basic odd jobs so I could focus completely on my
                        studies. My
                        wife was of great help!
                    </p>

                    {/* </p> */}
                    <h4>How did the initial industry exposure at TRL and further research experience inspire you to
                        establish
                        Y-Carbon? </h4>
                    <p>Definitely, there is a big role of Tata Refractories Limited (TRL) in shaping my career. TRL used to
                        hire
                        students from engineering colleges and they used to call them graduate trainees. Before we joined,
                        the
                        graduate trainees got a year or a year and half of training and then you would be placed into a job.
                        In our
                        case, that's not what happened. TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and
                        visionary
                        leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The
                        training was
                        not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We
                        learned
                        by working. When you start working and are accountable for your job, you start learning quickly. In
                        the
                        process, I was placed in the Dolomite Department as a Senior Officer and I was the second-in-charge
                        there. I
                        performed very well at Dolomite and liked my job. When you are in such an accountable position at an
                        early
                        age, it would likely have a positive impact on your career. My experience at TRL wasn't the only
                        factor in
                        starting Y-Carbon, because I wasn't aspiring to start a company at that time but it did help me in
                        my
                        career.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>From being the general secretary of Ceramic engineering de-partment to Co-founder, CTO/CEO & Board
                        Member of
                        Y Carbon and now a Senior Specialist, Technology & Acquisition at Sabic you have occupied numerous
                        positions
                        of responsibilities. How do you manage the pressure and despondency at the same time ? </h4>
                    <p>We generally spend more time working than any other activity. Work can be quite stressful if you
                        don't enjoy
                        it. Stress would naturally come to someone who is expecting a lot from his/her life. I was not very
                        good at
                        handling stress although I was better than others. For the last seven years, I've started spending
                        around an
                        hour daily on meditation and that has helped me immensely in maintaining work-life balance and
                        calming down
                        my restless mind. A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage
                        in
                        other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby,
                        I spend
                        time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am
                        slowly
                        picking woodworking as a hobby. And as time passes, when you get more mature you can handle things
                        much more
                        easily than when you were young. One has to understand that life is not only about work, and in
                        order to
                        live a complete life, he/she has to engage in non-work activities.
                    </p>

                    <h4>A message to the students and readers.</h4>
                    <p>In general, there are a few things that have helped me immensely in my career. One of them is I do
                        seek
                        advice from experienced professionals and mentors. A lot of people don't have mentors, instead, they
                        believe
                        in learning from their own mistakes which is great but it takes time. You can considerably
                        accelerate the
                        learn-ing if you learn from other's mistakes. I would suggest students have mentors so that you can
                        learn
                        from other's mistakes. I have been quite disappointed that the NIT Rourkela community (stu-dent,
                        faculty,
                        and alumni) don't make efficient use of its vast alumni base to seek guidance. Alumni can be great
                        mentors
                        and they can come for free.
